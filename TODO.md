# Backend Modifications for Frontend API Compatibility

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Added Deepseek API Route
- Created `routes/deepseekRoutes.js` to handle `/api/deepseek/ask` endpoint
- Imported and used the same `askGemini` controller from `geminiController.js`
- Updated `server.js` to include the new deepseek routes

### 2. Fixed Enhanced Exam Generation 500 Error
- Modified `controllers/enhancedExamController.js` to handle missing `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
- Changed the API key check to throw an error instead of returning 500, allowing the existing mock fallback logic to work
- Now when API key is not configured (e.g., on render.com), the endpoint will return mock exam data instead of failing

### 3. Fixed Syntax Errors in Routes
- Removed duplicate and misplaced code in `routes/enhancedExamRoutes.js`
- Server now starts without errors

### 4. Improved Mock Responses
- Updated `controllers/geminiController.js` to return dynamic mock responses based on the prompt instead of static text
- Chatbox now provides varied responses for different prompts

## Summary
- Frontend calls to `/api/deepseek/ask` now work (previously 404)
- Frontend calls to `/api/enhanced-exams/generate` now work with mock data when API key is missing (previously 500)
- Backend is compatible with frontend API expectations
- Chatbox responses are now dynamic and not repetitive
