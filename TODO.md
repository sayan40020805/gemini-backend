# Backend Modifications for Frontend API Compatibility

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Added Deepseek API Route
- Created `routes/deepseekRoutes.js` to handle `/api/deepseek/ask` endpoint
- Imported and used the same `askGemini` controller from `geminiController.js`
- Updated `server.js` to include the new deepseek routes

### 2. Fixed Enhanced Exam Generation 500 Error
- Modified `controllers/enhancedExamController.js` to handle missing `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
- Changed the API key check to throw an error instead of returning 500, allowing the existing mock fallback logic to work
- Now when API key is not configured (e.g., on render.com), the endpoint will return mock exam data instead of failing

### 3. Fixed Syntax Errors in Routes
- Removed duplicate and misplaced code in `routes/enhancedExamRoutes.js`
- Server now starts without errors

### 4. Improved Mock Responses
- Updated `controllers/geminiController.js` to return dynamic mock responses based on the prompt instead of static text
- Chatbox now provides varied responses for different prompts

### 5. Added Subjects Endpoint
- Added GET `/api/enhanced-exams/subjects` route to return a list of available subjects
- Frontend can now fetch subjects for the dropdown

### 6. Created Frontend API Utility
- Created `src/utils/api.js` with axios instance configured for correct base URL
- Handles both development (localhost:5000) and production (render.com) environments

### 7. Improved Mock Exam Options
- Updated mock exam questions to have more realistic and varied option text instead of generic "Option A, B, C, D"

## Summary
- Frontend calls to `/api/deepseek/ask` now work (previously 404)
- Frontend calls to `/api/enhanced-exams/generate` now work with mock data when API key is missing (previously 500)
- Added `/api/enhanced-exams/subjects` endpoint for subject selection
- Backend is compatible with frontend API expectations
- Chatbox responses are now dynamic and not repetitive
- Mock exam options are more descriptive

## Next Steps for User
- Copy `src/utils/api.js` to your frontend project
- Redeploy the backend to apply the new routes
- Set a valid `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable on your deployment platform to use real AI instead of mock responses
